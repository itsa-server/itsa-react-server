# itsa-react-server

Build high-performent and easy manageable SPAs based on React.js
MVC server for serverside rendered react apps.

You can use the **itsa-cli** to setup new web-applications. A full description, visit [http://itsaserver.io](http://itsaserver.io).

## Installation

Step 1: install itsa-cli globally:

```
npm install -g itsa-cli
```

## Creating applications

Once you have all these packages, you can create a new web-application like this:

### Create a new application:

```js
itsa create appname
```

`appname` will become a new folder with all appropriate files.

### Check the new application

Goto the created folder and run:

```js
npm run start
```

As soon as the message **Server running development at port: 3001** appears, you can open a browser and visit **http://localhost:3001**. The `Hello World!` app should come up.

See http://itsaserver.io for the complete documentation and usage.
